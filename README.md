## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Technical Breakdown)

This application is a modern web app built with a focus on client-side processing and AI integration.

1.  **Frontend**: Built with **React** and **TypeScript** for a robust and type-safe component-based architecture. Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, responsive, and modern look.
2.  **Data Parsing**: All file parsing happens directly in the browser for privacy and speed.
    -   **PapaParse**: Used for parsing CSV files.
    -   **SheetJS (XLSX)**: Used for parsing Excel (.xlsx) files.
    -   Native `JSON.parse` for JSON files.
3.  **AI Integration (Gemini API)**:
    -   When a file is uploaded, the application sends a small sample of the data (the first 5 rows), along with column headers and inferred data types, to the **`gemini-2.5-flash`** model.
    -   A carefully designed prompt instructs the model to act as a data analyst and suggest up to 6 diverse and meaningful chart configurations.
    -   The Gemini API's `responseSchema` feature is used to enforce a strict JSON output, ensuring the AI's response is always in the correct format for the application to render.
4.  **Chart Rendering**: The powerful **Recharts** library is used to render the interactive and visually appealing charts.
5.  **Dashboard Export**:
    -   **html2canvas**: This library captures a high-quality screenshot of the dashboard component.
    -   **jsPDF**: This library takes the captured image and embeds it into a PDF document for easy saving and sharing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   A package manager like `npm` or `yarn`
-   A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-dashboard-converter.git
    cd interactive-dashboard-converter
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    -   Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.
    -   Add your Gemini API key to this file:
    ```
    API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```
    *This project uses Vite, which automatically loads environment variables from `.env` files and exposes them via `import.meta.env`. The code is set up to use `process.env` as a standard, which is compatible with many hosting platforms.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

5.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your terminal).

## USAGE

1.  **Upload Data**: On the main screen, drag and drop your data file (CSV, XLSX, or JSON) onto the upload area, or click to select a file from your computer.
2.  **AI Analysis**: The application will show a loader while it sends your data sample to the Gemini API and waits for chart suggestions.
3.  **Explore Your Dashboard**: Your new dashboard will appear, populated with the AI-generated charts.
4.  **Customize**:
    -   Click on any chart's title to edit it.
    -   Use the dropdown menu on a chart card to change its type (e.g., from Bar to Line).
    -   Click the trash icon to remove a chart.
5.  **Export**:
    -   Click the "PNG" or "PDF" buttons in the header to save a snapshot of your dashboard.
6.  **Reset**:
    -   Click the refresh icon in the header to clear the current dashboard and start over with a new file.
